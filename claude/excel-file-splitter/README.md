# Excel Splitter

The Excel Splitter is created by Claude AI model. It generates the code perfectly. You may find the demo page at the
https://john.hu/practices/claude/excel-splitter/index.html


It creates the project following the instructions and improves the porject iteratively. No any human modifications in
the source code.

In the 2nd test, we meet the following issues:
* `Error: Cannot find module '@tailwindcss/forms'`. This is caused by the tailwind.config.js generated by Claude. We
can fix it by removing the `@tailwindcss/forms` from the tailwind.config.js
* `xlsx__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_4__.utils.write is not a function`. This is caused by the module system. It uses
`import { read, utils } from 'xlsx';` at first. After telling it the issue, it fixed it with
`import * as XLSX from 'xlsx';` that is correct one.
